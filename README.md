# ActivityLifecycle
 The Android activity lifecycle starts with onCreate() for initialization, followed by onStart() when the activity becomes visible. onResume() is triggered when the activity is in the foreground. onPause() occurs when it's partially obscured, and onStop() when it's fully hidden, leading to possible onDestroy() for cleanup.
